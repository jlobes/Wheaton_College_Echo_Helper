Echo Models:
  Echo Dot Second Generation - $50
  Echo Second Generation - $100

  It seems like the only difference is the dot doesn't come with a speaker. Which we wouldn't need for this project anyway.
    -- the dot doesn't come with a big huge speaker, but there is a little one that audio output does come from - JL
  
Echo Locations:
  I'm thinking every class building so that would be:
    1. Meneeley
    2. Watson
    3. Knapton
    4. Mars
    5. New / Old Science? - JL
  So four echo dots at least if we just want to do class buildings.
  
  
Skill Ideas:
  - Building identifier. (What building am I in?)
  - Office hours and location.
  - Exam hours and location. - JL
